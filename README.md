## Interesting Codes
This is an open source project to help begiiners to start programming and create interest for programmings among kids. 
This repo will be a reference guide  for exploring various programming language syntax and to learn
code for making computer science education better for children. We will be happy if you add some good codes to help our community
and make next generation coding ninjas.
# How To Contribute to This Project
Here ia a quick and painless steps to contribute to this project:

* Add your code in any language, under specific directories.
* Code level-any level from 'Hello world' to Anything.
* Highly appreciable if you add some playing codes/small games or puzzle or anything similar (eg. Tower of Hanoi problem) 
*  Also not to forget to add a 'description.md' file with a few lines under the specific directory.
To do so, first create an issue with the task you are doing, for example: "Issue - creating a tic-tac game". 
Add the `HacktoberFest` label in the issue and assign the issue to yourself. Create a pull request in response
to that issue and finally submit it for review.

* Name your branch `username_yourtopicName`.

	Also create a directory for any new features/code if it doesn't exist.
	Inside these directories you can create your own file named `program_name.language_extension` (`hello_world.cpp`)
	Create a commit of the form - fixes #(issue_number)

* Finally, wait for it to be merged!
