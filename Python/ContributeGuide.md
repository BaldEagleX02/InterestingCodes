## Guidelines for Python
* Make new directory (eg. 'myproject') under this Python directory and add your codes and include a README.md file( eg. 'description.md')
explaining about the code function, in one or two lines. 
* If the program is simple and programe name ( good naming convention is necessary) is enough then no need to add README.md file.
